# AppDynamics Add-On for Amazon EKS Blueprints

The AppDynamics Add-On for [Amazon EKS Blueprints](https://github.com/aws-ia/terraform-aws-eks-blueprints) 
enables platform administrators to install the AppDynamics 
[Kubernetes and App Service Monitoring](https://docs.appdynamics.com/fso/cloud-native-app-obs/en/kubernetes-and-app-service-monitoring) 
solution for 
[Cloud Native Application Observability](https://docs.appdynamics.com/fso/cloud-native-app-obs/en/about-cloud-native-application-observability) 
using Helm charts via Terraform.  

**NOTE:** This project is currently in Beta and is a work-in-progress. Deployment-ready updates are expected soon! (mid-October 2023).

## Introduction

Cloud Native Application Observability is Ciscoâ€™s Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) product for observing, securing, and optimizing 
large, managed Kubernetes deployments. It provides real-time observability across your entire technology stack: applications, 
software-defined compute, storage, services, network, and other infrastructure, through the collection and correlation of metrics, 
events, logs, and traces (MELT).  

This illustration shows a high-level overview of how Cloud Native Application Observability works:

The Kubernetes and App Service Monitoring solution provides visibility into your Kubernetes infrastructure and services for 
Application Performance Monitoring (APM).  

Kubernetes and App Service Monitoring allows you to:

-	Gain visibility into key Kubernetes metrics from various entities such as clusters, namespaces, workloads, pods, and ingress controllers.
-	Monitor hardware metrics from the server OS such as CPU and memory utilization, throughput on network interfaces, and disk and network I/O.
-	Correlate your Kubernetes infrastructure entities with your public cloud assets such as compute, storage, and load balancer, as well as APM services.
-	Monitor the Kubernetes events and application logs within your cluster.
-	Diagnose issues that may prevent uptime or obstruct scalability.

## Architecture Overview

The AppDynamics-provided Helm charts deploy the following components:

### Collectors

| Collector                                 | Usage                                                            |
|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Cluster Collector                         | Collects Kubernetes data.
| Infrastructure Collector                  | Collects server and container data, known as Host Monitoring.
| Log Collector                             | Collects logs.
| Cisco AppDynamics OpenTelemetry Collector | Receives OTLP data from the Infrastructure Collector, Cluster Collector, and Log Collector.

### Operators

| Operator                                  | Usage                                                            |
|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| AppDynamics Operator                      | These two operators are responsible for the life-cycle management of `appdynamics-collectors` and allow you to inject and configure OpenTelemetry auto-instrumentation libraries. Currently, Java, NodeJS, and Python are supported for auto-injection.
| OpenTelemetry Operator for Kubernetes     |
| Orchestration Client                      | This operator is responsible for the life-cycle management of Kubernetes-related agents.

## Get Started

Before installing Kubernetes and App Service Monitoring solution, ensure that you meet the following requirements:

-	Your account is set up on Cloud Native Application Observability. See [Account Administration](https://docs.appdynamics.com/fso/cloud-native-app-obs/en/account-administration).
-	You are connected to the cluster that you want to monitor.
-	You have administrator privileges on the monitored cluster to run the Helm chart commands.
